                    <p>TAMUHACK X at A&M University was a life-changing experience. It was my very first hackathon. A couple days before the hackathon, I was taking the bus to a cafe to study some technologies I wanted to use during the competition. Out of nowhere, it started raining heavily, as it usually does in Houston. I was not prepared in the slightest for that heavy downpour. No raincoat, no rainboots, but most importantly, no umbrella. That day, my clothes, shoes, and unfortunately, my very expensive laptop, all got completely soaked.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>I was thinking of quitting, but a friend with a potato laptop came to my rescue. I was able to code on the laptop for the hackathon, with a measly 4gb RAM. With this laptop, my team secured over $400 in prizes each, across 4 different categories. This is not only one of my proudest achievements, but also one of my fondest memories.</p>

                    <p>Technologies used: Javascript, React, Pixi.js, Open AI API, Cloudflare, 7 Redbulls</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Our concept was a gamified educational platform about space. We had an assistant AI chatbot to teach kids about space, which was specifically engineered to do so.</p>
